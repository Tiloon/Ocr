# OCAML : Optical Character Analysis and Machine Learning

OCAML is a new OCR (Optical Character Recognition) made as second year project
at EPITA. It have to be made in C and have to be done in less than 10 weeks.

## Website

For this project we had to make a website, so it is hoste at this adress :
http://ocrocaml.ovh

## Installation

In order to install this program, you need gtk 2 developpement libraries and a
C99 compliant compiler (like clang or gcc).
build with :

    make
    make proper

## Usage

In order to try OCAML, you should write in your terminal

    ./ocrocaml -i "picfile"

where "picfile" is the path to the picture you would like to  picture to process. You can add the "-v" flag to set verbosity on.
There is a plenty of option in OCAML in order to have the best recognicion of you text.
Here are some of them :

	-f filter_name,arg1,arg2

apply filter to the loaded picture

	-osegmentation "file"
	-ofilters "file"

save a picture in "file" after segmentation process or filter application process.

	-rules

Apply some rules to have more accurate results in the character recognition process.

	-kerning

Apply inteligent segmentation for kerning detection.

### Graphical User Interface

You may want to use the GTK user interface with

	ocrocaml -gui

### Neural Network


	./ocrocaml nn [args]          Neural network setup
You can learn specific fonts from your BMP files. If you want to modify the recognized characters you just have to change the number of patterns in const.h and the error threeshold with the carset with the good orders of characters. Here are the available arguments :

	-learning                       Start the learning process
    -serialize                      Serialize the NN into serialize
    -datasetsfiles [files]          Comma separated file list

For exemple, if you wanna learn 3 fonts (1.bmp - 2.bmp and 3.bmp) and you want to serialize your data, here is the following code to type :
	./ocrocaml nn -learning -serialize -datasetsfiles 1.bmp,2.bmp,3.bmp
If the BMP files haven't the good amount of characters, it will stop immediately and will notice it to you. It can learn about 1400 differents characters with an acceptable error threeshold. Enjoy spending your time in front of learning process!
