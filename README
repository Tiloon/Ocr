# OCAML : Optical Character Analysis and Machine Learning

OCAML is a new OCR (Optical Character Recognition) made as second year project
at EPITA. It have to be made in C and have to be done in less than 10 weeks.

## Website

For this project we had to make a website, so it is hoste at this adress :
http://ocrocaml.ovh

## Installation

In order to install this program, you need gtk 2 developpement libraries and a
C99 compliant compiler (like clang or gcc).
build with :

    make
    make proper

## Usage

In order to try OCAML, you should write in your terminal

    ./ocrocaml -i "picfile"

where "picfile" is the path to the picture you would like to  picture to process.

There is a plenty of option in OCAML in order to have the best recognicion of you text.
Here are some of them :
